# Python OOP Exercise: Simple Library System

## Objective
This assignment helps practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python such as defining classes, creating objects, using constructors (`__init__`), managing attributes and methods, and applying encapsulation.

## Scenario
Create a simple library management system that can store information about books and perform operations like adding books, checking them out, and checking them back in.

## Features
- `Book` class with attributes like title, author, and availability status.
- `Library` class to manage a collection of `Book` objects.
- Methods to add books, check out books, and return books.
- Demonstrates class interaction and encapsulation.

c
